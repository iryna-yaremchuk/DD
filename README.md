# How to write a good readme
## Readme is the first file one should read when starting a new project
### It's a set of useful information about a project, and a kind of manual 
**A good README is for others to understand what our code includes, and why it's noteworthy.**

*Even if the code is just for you, possibly you will come back to it after a while. A good README enables you to relaunch a project - without wasting your time on recalling:*
***What was it all about?***
```
Don't igonre readme files
```
